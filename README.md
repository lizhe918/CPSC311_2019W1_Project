# CPSC311_2019W1_Project

## About
This repository is used for the group project of UBC CPSC311, 2019WT1. The group has five members, all of whom are current UBC undergraduate students. The intention of this group project is to design and construct the interpretor of a new programming language, which can help computer science instructors draw logical circuits and data structures like binary tree more easily. 

## The Language
We name the language to be **"CSEdu"**. The reason why we want to create this new language is that drawing logical circuits, trees, and graphs are difficult to accomplish on softwares like MS Office and Logism, and the low efficiency of getting the image of the circuit or data strucutre is the most time-consuming part in class preparation. With this language, we will be able to create the image we want purely on keyboard in a much more efficient way: programming.

## The Method
We will apply the method learnt in CPSC311 and use **plai** in DrRacket to create CSEdu. We will first disign the concrete syntax of the language, which will be available in future releases. Then, we will work on designing the appropriate datatype and the parser for parsing expressions in concrete syntax to our abstract syntax. Finally, we construct the interpreter for CSEdu. The specific definition of data type and function definition will follow the CPSC110 HtDD and HtDF recipes, which guarantees that the code is well documented and thoroughly tested.
