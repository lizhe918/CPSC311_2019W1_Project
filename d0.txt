Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

1. type 5: design a new language that can help computer science instructors and students draw logical circuits and data structures like tree more efficiently purely based on using standard keyboard.  

2. type 4: use Erlang (for parallel computing) to design a program (e.g. 3d rendering, game(puzzle such as minesweeper, Rubikâ€™s cube, 2048) solving), subject to change

3.
