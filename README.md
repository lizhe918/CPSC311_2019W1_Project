# CPSC311_2019W1_Project

## About
This repository is used for the group project of UBC CPSC311, 2019WT1. The group has five members, all of whom are current UBC undergraduate students. The intention of this group project is to design and construct the interpretor of a new programming language, which can help computer science instructors draw logical circuits and data structures like binary tree more easily. 

## The Language
We name the language to be **"CSEdu"**. The reason why we want to create this new language is that drawing logical circuits, trees, and graphs are difficult to accomplish on softwares like MS Office and Logism, and the low efficiency of getting the image of the circuit or data strucutre is the most time-consuming part in class preparation. With this language, we will be able to create the image we want purely on keyboard in a much more efficient way: programming.

## The Method
We will apply the method learnt in CPSC311 and use **plai** in DrRacket to create CSEdu. We will first disign the concrete syntax of the language, which will be available in future releases. Then, we will work on designing the appropriate datatype and the parser for parsing expressions in concrete syntax to our abstract syntax. Finally, we construct the interpreter for CSEdu. The specific definition of data type and function definition will follow the CPSC110 HtDD and HtDF recipes, which guarantees that the code is well documented and thoroughly tested. 

## The Deliverables
Currently, we are working on d0 to specify the milestones and propose our idea. The due for d0 is Oct 2nd, 2019 at noon. The file for d0 is d0.txt in the repository.

### d0: Project Commit
#### Requirements
EVERY member of the team submits an identical plain text document named project-commit.txt to the handin target project-commit with the following form completed:

Team Member Names:

Team Member Student IDs:

Team Member ugrad.cs.ubc.ca Logins:

Initial level commitment (80%, 90%, or 100%):

Tutorial time that at least one and ideally all members will guarantee to attend
each week:

3+ hours weekly that the group guarantees EACH OTHER to be available
to meet (ideally face-to-face):

Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

1. 

2. 

3. 
This deliverable should be quite short.

Once we have the deliverable, weâ€™ll assign you a project facilitator from the CPSC 311 staff. From then on, you can direct questions to that facilitator, work with them to help you stay on track, and start figuring out how they interpret the project guidelines and marking scheme so you can get a great grade!

#### Marking Scheme
4 points <br>
Submission format is correct, e.g., all members submitted identical plain text files on time with all required fields complete.
4 points <br>
Proposed project(s)-of-interest show: thought about a range of different project options, initial effort at exploring the proposed options, and the potential of growing into a proposal.
This milestone may not be resubmitted at a later time.
