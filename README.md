# CPSC311_2019W1_Project

## About
This repository is used for the group project of UBC CPSC311, 2019WT1. The group has five members, all of whom are current UBC undergraduate students. The intention of this group project is to design and construct the interpretor of a new programming language, which can help computer science instructors draw logical circuits and data structures like binary tree more easily. 

## The Language
We name the language to be **"CSEdu"**. The reason why we want to create this new language is that drawing logical circuits, trees, and graphs are difficult to accomplish on softwares like MS Office and Logism, and the low efficiency of getting the image of the circuit or data strucutre is the most time-consuming part in class preparation. With this language, we will be able to create the image we want purely on keyboard in a much more efficient way: programming.

## Method
We will apply the method learnt in CPSC311 and use **plai** in DrRacket to create CSEdu. We will first disign the concrete syntax of the language, which will be available in future releases. Then, we will work on designing the appropriate datatype and the parser for parsing expressions in concrete syntax to our abstract syntax. Finally, we construct the interpreter for CSEdu. The specific definition of data type and function definition will follow the CPSC110 HtDD and HtDF recipes, which guarantees that the code is well documented and thoroughly tested. 

## Deliverables
Currently, we are working on d0 to specify the milestones and propose our idea. The due for d0 is **Oct 2nd, 2019 at noon**. The file for d0 is **d0.txt** in the repository.

### d0: Project Commit
#### Requirements
EVERY member of the team submits an identical plain text document named project-commit.txt to the handin target project-commit with the following form completed:

Team Member Names:

Team Member Student IDs:

Team Member ugrad.cs.ubc.ca Logins:

Initial level commitment (80%, 90%, or 100%):

Tutorial time that at least one and ideally all members will guarantee to attend
each week:

3+ hours weekly that the group guarantees EACH OTHER to be available
to meet (ideally face-to-face):

Three one-sentence ideas the team might pursue for the project. Note:
Each idea should be plausible enough to show that the group has done
some thought and reading about it. Each should have the potential to
develop into a real project. Together, they should explore some
meaningfully distinct project options (so, not just three variations
on the same project).

This deliverable should be quite short.

Once we have the deliverable, we’ll assign you a project facilitator from the CPSC 311 staff. From then on, you can direct questions to that facilitator, work with them to help you stay on track, and start figuring out how they interpret the project guidelines and marking scheme so you can get a great grade!

#### Marking Scheme
4 points <br>
Submission format is correct, e.g., all members submitted identical plain text files on time with all required fields complete.
<br>
4 points <br>
Proposed project(s)-of-interest show: thought about a range of different project options, initial effort at exploring the proposed options, and the potential of growing into a proposal.
This milestone may not be resubmitted at a later time.

### d1 Project Proposal
Your proposal lays out the project type you have chosen, the particular project topic you’re interested in (e.g., for the project type that changes the semantics of a language: which language, what change, and why), and sketches a plan for fulfilling the subsequent milestones, particularly Background Research Report and Poster. Your proposal shows that your team has laid the groundwork to succeed in these milestones, including specifying the key high-level goals of the project you’d perform were you going to the 100% level, finding useful starting points to explore the literature and documentation surrounding the project, and describing examples of how you imagine that project working.

#### Deliverable
The deliverable is the report itself in PDF format. Choose any professional-looking format, but we recommend the ACM proceedings format used for many Computer Science conference papers. Include a title for your project (prefaced by Proposal:), names and contact information for your team members, and everything else needed to fulfill the description above and marking scheme below. The document should be named project-proposal.pdf and handed in by ONE team member to the target project-proposal. (Subsequent resubmissions use the same filename but later milestones’ handin targets. Only resubmit the file if you wish to be remarked!)

#### Marking Scheme
4 points

Submission format is correct, e.g., ONE copy, submitted by one team member, on time.

4 points

The proposed project topic illustrates how it meets the requirements of its project type. You must describe at a high level how it could be a full 100% project, even if you’re aiming for 80% or 90%.

4 points

The proposal lays out a clear, low-risk approach to meeting the 80% level project requirements.

4 points

The proposal lists three (or more) documents that serve as promising starting points for the team to work from as they explore the literature and documentation around their project for their background report.
This deliverable is limited to four pages (with reasonable font/margin sizes, e.g., as in the ACM format above). We prefer a significantly shorter document, however. Practice brevity! Shoot for 2.5 pages.

This milestone may be resubmitted once (at the next milestone) for full credit as long as the team earned at least 8 points on the first submission.
